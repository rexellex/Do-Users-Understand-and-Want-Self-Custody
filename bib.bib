In order to use {LN}, funds need to be locked in payment channels on the Bitcoin blockchain (Layer-1) for subsequent use in {LN} (Layer-2). {LN} is comprised of many payment channels forming a payment channel network. {LN}’s promise is that relatively few payment channels already enable anyone to efficiently, securely and privately route payments across the whole network. In this paper, we quantify the structural properties of {LN} and argue that {LN}’s current topological properties can be ameliorated in order to improve the security of {LN}, enabling it to reach its true potential.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin introduced a cryptographic peer-to-peer version of money that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Many recent studies evaluated and criticised Bitcoin’s energy consumption through its Proof of Work ({PoW}) consensus mechanism without evaluating its efficiency compared to classical electronic payment system.Based on physics, information science and economics, we compute and compare the energy consumption and define what is the energy efficiency of both the current monetary payment system and Bitcoin cryptopayment system. We demonstrate that Bitcoin consumes at least 28 times less energy and can run today with 60 times less energy than the classical system. At a single transaction level and with total volumes accounted for, Bitcoin produces equivalent energy efficiency rates or better. When Bitcoin Lightning is compared to Instant Payment scheme, Bitcoin gains exponentially in scalability and efficiency, proving to be millions of times more energy efficient per transaction than Instant Payments.},

The Herfindahl index for the top 10 is 1009; the network is 19\% less concentrated after the merge. Ethereum supply growth has been deflationary since the merge. The time between consecutive blocks is now steady at 12 s and transactions per day are up 7.0\%. On Polygon, Matic fees rose but token fees fell. Polygon also slows, processing 3.3\% fewer transactions per day. Solana’s fees fall by \$0.0003, and transactions per day are down 48\%.

            Bitcoin provides its users with transaction-processing services which are similar to those of traditional payment systems. This article models the novel economic structure implied by Bitcoin’s innovative decentralized design, which allows the payment system to be reliably operated by unrelated parties called miners. We find that this decentralized design protects users from monopoly pricing. Competition among service providers within the platform and free entry imply no entity can profitably affect the level of fees paid by users. Instead, a market for transaction-processing determines the fees users pay to gain priority and avoid transaction-processing delays. The article (i) derives closed-form formulas of the fees and waiting times and studies their properties, (ii) compares pricing under the Bitcoin Payment System to that under a traditional payment system operated by a profit-maximizing firm, and (iii) suggests protocol design modifications to enhance the platform’s efficiency. The Appendix describes and explains the main attributes of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology.},

	abstract = {We build on economic theory to discuss how blockchain technology can shape innovation and competition in digital platforms. We identify two key costs affected by the technology: the cost of verification and the cost of networking. The cost of verification relates to the ability to cheaply verify state, including information about past transactions and their attributes, and current ownership in a native digital asset. The cost of networking, instead, relates to the ability to bootstrap and operate a marketplace without assigning control to a centralized intermediary. This is achieved by combining the ability to cheaply verify state with economic incentives targeted at rewarding state transitions that are particularly valuable from a network perspective, such as the contribution of the resources needed to operate, scale, and secure a decentralized network. The resulting digital marketplaces allow participants to make joint investments in shared infrastructure and digital public utilities without assigning market power to a platform operator, and are characterized by increased competition, lower barriers to entry, and a lower privacy risk. Because of their decentralized nature, they also introduce new types of inefficiencies and governance challenges.},

However, since the beginning of its evolution, it has been highly criticised for the difficulties in dealing with it properly. As cryptocurrency is the most successful application of blockchain, we aim to identify the potential obstacles and usability issues, which might hinder its wide-scale adoption, of five applications (i.e., wallets) that are used to manage cryptocurrencies. Applying the analytical cognitive walk-through usability inspection method, we investigate common usability issues with desktop and mobile-based wallets. Our results reveal that both wallets lack good usability in performing the fundamental tasks which can be improved significantly. We summarise our findings and point out the aspects where the issues exists so that improving those areas can result in better user experience and adoption.},

There have been attempts to formulate digital money, but they have not been successful due to security and trust issues. However, blockchain needs no central authority, and its operations are controlled by the people who use it. Furthermore, it cannot be altered or forged, resulting in massive market hype and demand. Blockchain has moved past cryptocurrency and discovered implementations in other real-life applications; this is where we can expect blockchain technology to be simplified and not remain a complex concept. Blockchain technology’s desirable characteristics are decentralization, integrity, immutability, verification, fault tolerance, anonymity, audibility, and transparency. We first conduct a thorough analysis of blockchain technology in this paper, paying particular attention to its evolution, applications and benefits, the specifics of cryptography in terms of public key cryptography, and the challenges of blockchain in distributed transaction ledgers, as well as the extensive list of blockchain applications in the financial transaction system. This paper presents a detailed review of blockchain technology, the critical challenges faced, and its applications in different fields. Blockchain in the transaction system is explained in detail with a summary of different cryptocurrencies. Some of the suggested solutions are given in the overall study of the paper.},

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.},

Behavior data was based on monitoring 3,780 visits to the resource center over a 12-week period. Weighted least squares estimation revealed that all three models performed well in terms of fit and were roughly equivalent in terms of their ability to explain behavior. Decomposing the belief structures in the Theory of Planned Behavior provided a moderate increase in the explanation of behavioral intention. Overall, the results indicate that the decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior provides a fuller understanding of behavioral intention by focusing on the factors that are likely to influence systems use through the application of both design and implementation strategies.},

              The purpose of this study is to investigate the antecedents of behavioral intention to use ({BIU}) mobile payment in Indonesia by extending unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ({UTAUT}) with user privacy constructs, namely, perceived security ({PS}), perceived risk ({PR}) and trust (Tr).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This is a quantitative research using the covariance-based structural equation modeling method, whereby the researchers conducted an online survey and distributed online questionnaires to users of mobile payment from all over Indonesia to obtain the data. The sample in this study consisted of 358 respondents.
            
            
              Findings
              This study found that social influence, facilitating conditions, {PS}, performance expectancy and Tr have a significant and direct influence on {BIU} mobile payment. {PR} was not found to have a significant and direct relationship with {BIU}, but it was indirectly affecting the latter through Tr as the mediating variable.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The researchers modified {UTAUT} by incorporating {PS}, {PR} and Tr to create a more comprehensive model in predicting mobile payment adoption, especially considering the risky nature of digital transactions in emerging economies like Indonesia. This extended model has never been thoroughly explored in previous studies.},

              At first sight, web surveys seem to be an interesting and attractive means of data collection. They provide simple, cheap, and fast access to a large group of potential respondents. However, web surveys are not without methodological problems. Specific groups in the populations are under‐represented because they have less access to Internet. Furthermore, recruitment of respondents is often based on self‐selection. Both under‐coverage and self‐selection may lead to biased estimates. This paper describes these methodological problems. It also explores the effect of various correction techniques (adjustment weighting and use of reference surveys). This all leads to the question whether properly design web surveys can be used for data collection. The paper attempts to answer this question. It concludes that under‐coverage problems may solve itself in the future, but that self‐selection leads to unreliable survey outcomes.

            Résumé
             A première vue, les enquêtes en ligne semble être un moyen intéressant et attrayant de collecte de données. Ils fournissent un accès simple, rapide et peu coûteux à un grand groupe de répondants potentiels. Les enquêtes en ligne ne sont toutefois pas sans problèmes méthodologiques. Certains groupes au sein des populations sont sous‐représentés parce qu'ils ont un accès restreint à Internet. En outre, le recrutement des personnes interrogées est souvent fondé sur l'auto‐sélection. Sous‐couverture et auto‐sélection peuvent toutes deux être la source d'estimations biaisées. Le présent article décrit ces problèmes méthodologiques. Il explore également l'effet des différentes techniques de correction (pondération corrective et utilisation d'enquêtes de référence). Tout ceci amène à la question de savoir si des enquêtes en ligne bien conçues sont propres àêtre utilisées pour la collecte de données. L'article tente de répondre à cette question. Il conclut que le problème de la sous‐couverture pourrait se résoudre dans l'avenir, mais que l'auto‐sélection aboutit à des résultats d'enquête non fiables.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Given the growing importance of blockchain technology ({BT}), the authors use the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ({UTAUT}), which posits that {BT} adoption intention depends on the complementarity between {UTAUT} and blockchain transparency ({BTRAN}) and examine it in a new setting: the boundary condition of perceived helpfulness.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors review the major conceptual literature on both {UTAUT} and {BT} to identify their principal common factors. They examine the complementarity between {UTAUT} and {BTRAN} and further test the moderating effect of perceived helpfulness. The authors used the {PLS} technique for data analysis because this technique can test the direct and interaction effects.
            
            
              Findings
              The complementarity between {UTAUT} and {BTRAN} strongly affects {BT} adoption intention. The authors further show that perceived helpfulness moderates the relationship between adoption intention and usage behavior. At high levels of perceived helpfulness, usage behavior increases rapidly with adoption intention.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The results indicate that {UTAUT} is a valuable theory to identify the determinants of adoption intention, confirming its robustness in blockchain-enabled supply chain management. The combination of {UTAUT} and {BTRAN} can contribute a plausible approach to the strategy literature: the complementarity effect might create more benefits than adopting a single practice.},

Instead of being dependent on a centralised mediator like bank, by using blockchain, parties can transfer fund promptly trough connected ledgers called blocks. Using this method transactions will significantly be more transparent for both parties. Consequently, transactions are performed based on the distributed trust among other blockchain users in the network. Blockchain will promote transparency in every industry, yet implementation of blockchain technology is still limited.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has received a lot of interest in recent years because of its potential to disrupt various industries. However, the effective adoption of blockchain technology is dependent not only on the capabilities of the technology itself but also on the attitudes of people toward the technology. Focusing on the roles of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and personal innovativeness, this study aimed to investigate how attitudes affect blockchain technology adoption in an emerging market. The process of designing and verifying the model, which was centered on the Technology Acceptance Model ({TAM}) and the Innovation Diffusion Theory ({IDT}), made use of structural equation modeling. The {TAM} and {IDT} served as the foundation for the model. The study found that one's attitude has a substantial impact on adoption, and that this impact is enhanced when one's attitude is also related to their perception of the technology's usability and their own propensity for innovation. The survey included 347 professionals from an emerging market. Perceived ease of use and personal innovativeness are moderately mediated by attitude, but perceived ease of use and adoption are strongly influenced by attitude. Multiple factors, such as personal innovativeness, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude, were shown to play significant roles in the early market acceptance of blockchain technology. The findings of this study give important insights for practitioners and policymakers who are striving to stimulate blockchain use and add significantly to the body of research regarding the psychological components that drive blockchain adoption},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the variables influencing the expansion of cryptocurrency (crypto for short) use in households. To carry on the study we apply a consumer-behavior focus and so-called fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis ({fsQCA}). In a previous research, that was grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}) and Partial Least Squares ({PLS}), we found that main factors to explain the intention to use of cryptos by individuals were performance expectancy (in fact, it was the main factor), effort expectancy and facilitating conditions. We did not found evidences about the relevance of social influence, perceived risk and financial literacy. This study revisits these results by applying {fsQCA} instead {PLS}. Empirical research on factors influencing cryto use is relatively scarce due to the novelty of blockchain techs, so the present paper expands the literature on this topic by using an original analytical tool in this context. The main contribution of this paper consists in showing empirically that {fsQCA} provides a complementary and enriching perspective to interpret data about the use of cryptos. We obtain again that the most relevant factor to explain the intention of using cryptocurrencies is perceived expectancy and that also effort expectancy and facilitation conditions are relevant. But also {fsQCA} has allowed us discovering that despite social influence, perceived risk and financial literacy were not significant in the {PLS} model, they impact on the intention to use cryptocurrencies when are combined with other factors. Social influence acts as an “enable factor” for the rest of explanatory variables and it is linked positively with intention to use cryptos. Also financial literacy is relevant because its lack is a sufficient condition for the non-acceptance of that blockchain tech. Likewise we have checked that perceived risk influences the intention of using cryptos. However, this influence may be positive or negative depending of the circumstances.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Blockchain systems have been proposed as a solution for exchanging electronic health records ({EHR}) because they enable data sharing in decentralised networks. This paper aims to analyse the user acceptability of blockchain technology in enabling {EHR} exchange and to formulate practical implications for increasing user acceptability.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A technology acceptance model [extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ({UTAUT}) model] was used as a framework to measure the effects of 13 factors. The authors conducted a survey and analysed data from 214 participants using partial least square path modelling.
            
            
              Findings
              The acceptance of blockchain for {EHR} sharing is positively influenced by performance expectancy, social influence and perceived trust. Effort expectancy and facilitating conditions do not influence acceptance. The {UTAUT} model explains the variance in acceptance at 58.4\%. Self-efficacy influences effort expectancy, incentives influence facilitating conditions and security predicts perceived trust.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Three implications are drawn: (1) Users need to clearly understand system’s purpose, functions, security mechanism and environmental impacts. (2) Users are incentivised to share health data via a blockchain solution if the technology offers personalising options and health information. (3) Health personnel can socially impact patients to use blockchain-based solutions.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Studies have shown that blockchain technology is a valuable solution for exchanging {EHR}. The novelty of this work is to identify how and why patients may accept this emerging technology for {EHR} exchange.},

	shorttitle = {Consensus Crash Testing},
	abstract = {The inception of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system, and its underlying blockchain data-structure and protocol, has led to an increased interest in deploying scalable and reliable distributed-ledger systems that build on robust consensus protocols. A critical requirement of such systems is to provide enough fault tolerance in the presence of adversarial attacks or network faults. This is essential to guarantee liveness when the network does not behave as expected and ensure that the underlying nodes agree on a unique order of transactions over a shared state. In comparison with traditional distributed systems, the deployment of a distributed-ledger system should take into account the hidden game theoretical aspects of such protocols, where actors are competing with each other in an environment which is likely to experience various well-motivated malicious and adversarial attacks. Firstly, this paper discusses the fundamental principles of existing consensus protocols in the context of both permissioned and permissionless distributed-ledger systems. The main contribution of this work deals with observations from experimenting with Ripple’s consensus protocol as it is embodied in the {XRP} Ledger. The main experimental finding suggests that, when a low percentage of malicious nodes is present, the centralization degree of the network can be significantly relaxed ensuring low convergence times. Those findings are of particular importance when engineering a consensus algorithm that would like to balance security with decentralization.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            Presently, auditing firms are hesitant to accept mandates from companies that hold a significant amount of cryptoassets, primarily because the blockchain sector introduces novel, technically sophisticated, and risky propositions that auditors are unequipped to handle. Abrupt recusals by auditors operating in this sector have led to several enterprises being placed on cease trade by securities regulators for failure to produce audited financial statements on time, thus impeding these companies from raising capital and bringing new investments to fund innovation in this space. Through an iterative process of interviews with senior accounting professionals, structured brainstorming among a multidisciplinary team of accountants and blockchain experts, and a focus group with experienced auditors, we critically analyze the purported roadblocks to auditing blockchain firms and map them to traditional auditing practices. We urge auditors to reconsider their resistance to the blockchain sector by demonstrating that providing an audit opinion is challenging but not insurmountable.},

After describing the fundamental externalities inherent in payment systems and analysing merchant resistance to interchange fee increases and the associations' determination of this fee, it derives the externalities' implications for welfare analysis. It then discusses whether consumer surplus or social welfare is the proper benchmark for regulatory purposes. Finally, it offers a critique of the current regulatory approach, and concludes with a call for more novel and innovative thinking about how to reconcile regulators' concerns and the industry legitimate desire to perform its balancing act.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency has revolutionized the economic system of the world. It provides a new and innovative means of exchange that has speedily invaded the financial market trends and changed the traditional cash world. However, consumers have low acceptability for blockchain-based cryptocurrency due to increasing online scams and the absence of a regulatory framework. There is also a misconception about its usage on many platforms, which has created a clear gap in the literature to address this issue. Therefore, the current study intends to investigate the effect of technology awareness on the behavioral intention of crypto users through perceived factors (usefulness, ease of use, risk). It also empirically examines the moderating role of government support on these indirect paths. The underlying framework is investigated by surveying 333 respondents from the Z generation. Results revealed that perceived factors (usefulness, ease of use, risk) mediate the relationship between technology awareness and behavioral intention. Furthermore, government support strengthens the indirect relationship of technology awareness on behavioral intention through technology acceptance determinants, such that the effect of technology awareness on behavioral intention through perceived factors (usefulness, ease of use, risk) is more assertive when government support is high. The findings will provide a new dimension to different financial bodies implementing monetary policy and highlight the need to adopt innovative digital technologies in Pakistan.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers ({AMMs}) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of {AMM}-based decentralized exchanges ({DEXs}), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general {AMM} framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top {AMM} protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by {AMM}-based {DEXs}’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both {DeFi} and conventional market microstructure.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to provide an empirically informed view on the auditing profession’s readiness to embrace “disruptive” technologies. Relying on evidence from Big 4 employees in Italy, this study examines the factors that motivate auditors to use blockchain technology ({BT}).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              To this aim, this study uses an integrated theoretical frame merging the third version of the technology acceptance model ({TAM}3) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ({UTAUT}). The analytical model is based on an application of the structural equation modelling with partial least square estimation on data gathered through a Likert-based questionnaire.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings reveal that the main predictors of auditors’ intention to use blockchain are performance expectancy and social influence. Moreover, auditors’ effort expectancy in relation to this technology implementation and use appears to be a reasonably reliable predictor.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper contributes an evidence-based view to the discussion on the impact of automation and disruptive information and communication technologies, on the roles of accounting and auditing professionals. It uses a novel approach to analysis by integrating {TAM}3 and {UTAUT} within its theoretical model. It complements and extends the field of studies on technology acceptance by offering fresh insights into auditors’ perceptions. Finally, the paper highlights practical implications for business leaders aiming to use the advantages of {BT} in audit firms.},
